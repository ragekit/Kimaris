#Crypto Seals

This is the result of two day of a speculative design jam/workshop on Deep Time, which happened on the 24th and 25th of September 2016, a Concordia University, Montreal

Those are crypto seals used to lock dangerous and forgotten technology away, and prevent far distant futur generation from accessing them withouth properly knowing how to handle them, and causing a catastrophe
